### Visual Diff Testing

This repo uses the [@brightspace-ui/visual-diff utility](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/visual-diff/) to compare current snapshots against a set of golden snapshots stored in source control.

```shell
# run visual-diff tests
npm run test:diff

# subset of visual-diff tests:
npm run test:diff -- -g some-pattern

# update visual-diff goldens
npm run test:diff:golden
```
