### Versioning and Releasing

This repo is configured to use `semantic-release`. Commits prefixed with `fix:` and `feat:` will trigger patch and minor releases when merged to `main`.

To learn how to create major releases and release from maintenance branches, refer to the [semantic-release GitHub Action](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/actions/tree/main/semantic-release) documentation.
